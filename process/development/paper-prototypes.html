    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This is the first iteration of my paper prototype for my Portfolio Review website. For this prototype, I tried to make straight forward and user friendly. This prototype shows a scroll to indicate infinity scrolls and that users can move
      down. I tried to incorporate lots of alert/pop up messages for the user and obvious buttons. The first prototype was mostly successful. The first issue with the first prototype is that when the user pressed the community page in their profile
      page, they didn't know where it lead to. A suggestion was to add a small description about where it'll take you. To help the user understand, I also added an popup that alerts the user that the page will be redirected to the community page. A
      second issue was that the user kept trying to scroll down the community page until they realized that it was the end of the page. I added a note in the end that it was the end of the page. The second iteration of my prototype was more
      successful than the first. It was straight forward and finished easily. The only problem was that when the person was in the profile page, the user kept trying to press on the portrait and nothing was happening. The user was a bit confused but
      eventually figured out to press the community page button. </p>
