    <p>For my topic brainstorm, I decided to do Creative and Cognition. For this year, Creative and Cognition's theme is Transformation Design. As stated on the website, their theme is to "how human and computational aspects of creativity can
      beneficially impact our communities and cultures, and how human experience impacts and is impacted by processes of creatively forming and solving problems, designing spaces, and building new possibilities. "</p>

    <p>To be honest, this brainstorm was a bit challenging considering I did not know what Transformation Design is, let alone Transformation Creativity. I had to do background research on its definition and what it truly means to create
      transformation design. To start off my brainstorm, I took the words from the theme in CC's website and thought about the relationship between how technology benefitted different types of people. The first on the list is the making of design
      programs such as Adobe Suites. Adobe has changed the way designers, especially graphic designers, have made their work. It has allowed them to think creatively and outside the box. The second is the improvement of online courses. The
      improvement of the interactivity and design of online courses have created better experiences for users to learn without the need of a traditional classroom. The third impact are designing apps for health and wellness. Many ordinary people are
      able to track their calories and steps and have the opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle. </p>

    <p>One of the ideas that popped into my head during this process is creating a portfolio website. Now this isn't another one of those "create your own portfolio website" but is a tool for designers to improve their portfolios. This website is a
      peer to peer portfolio website where other designers from around the world can critique and have a different perspective of your work. What is unique about this website compared to websites like Behance is that it focuses on critiques and
      improvement rather than showcasing work. It benefits designers who do not have enough connects and want their portfolios and/or specific works critique. Some benefits of the website include an actual portfolio viewing website where it can be
      used as a portfolio website for job internviews (hiding critiques). Another aspect is that people can put their previous jobs and experiences to add credibility. It has a featured system for best work and most improved to motivate and inspire
      other designers and so much more.</p>
