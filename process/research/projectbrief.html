    <h2>Project Brief</h2>

    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>There will be some designers who don’t get a job right away and will research projects that they can do on their own so they will be able to add it through their portfolio. Once designers are finished with a project, they don’t have a
      professor to reach out to for feedback. Reaching out on a professor for a thorough critique can also be a matter of how close their relationship is before the designer graduated. There are showcasing website like Behance and Dribbble, but what
      these websites lack is the ability to improve. People are able to comment through projects, but most of the comments don’t include how the work should be improve. This is why for my topic, I chose to create a website that allows other
      designers to critique each other’s work to improve their portfolio. This website will be a helpful tool for all types of designers as they create their portfolio page. The purpose of the portfolio review is to be able to get other feedback
      with a fresh set of eyes to help designers move forward with their projects. </p>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>Based on my experience, many of my designer classmates struggle with putting a portfolio together. They ask questions like “What should they put?” and “which one is my best work?” Most of these classmate include seniors who are about to
      graduate and don't know how to move on foward with all their work from previous classes. I have classmates who have graduated and want to fix and refine their projects to put in their portfolios but don't have access to a professor. The target
      audience for the portfolio review/critique website are post graduate students who want to improve their work but don’t have any connections to other designers. These could include designers who recently moved to a new state and don’t know
      anyone and post graduate students that struggle with networking with other designers. My target audience is global, which includes designers from all around the world. This will allow designers to get feedback from different point of views and
      perspectives. These are my targeted audience because, based on my experience, many classmates I know struggle with putting a portfolio together. </p>

    <h3>The Goals of the Project (and how it will work)</h3>
    <p>The goal of the portfolio review website is to improve and refine each other's work with the help of designers will be able to give and get feedback from other designers from around the world. The process of the website includes users to
      upload their work. They can upload any of the pieces they were thinking of using for their website. After they put their work, they are required to write a specific description of their work so other designers will know what the project is and
      its meaning. After that, the user can press submit and in a matter of no time, they will be able to receive feedback from other designers. For designers to critique on work, they must go to the community page and look for a project they want
      to review. The user can select any project that they see. On the top it will have a button that can direct them to the editing page, where the user is allowed to annotate and comment on the projects. After, the user can click submit and the
      other designer will receive a notification.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel (visual strategies, such as formal details including color and type)</h3>
    <p>This website will be friendly, engaging, user friendly, and professional. To keep its professional design, it focuses on color and typography rather than heavy illustrations.  This will help the users take the website more seriously and focus on each other's work rather than the website itself. The feel of the website will be straightforward and easy to navigate through. This website will incorporate design patterns from showcasing website (like Behance), such as horizontal navigation bar on top of the header. The navigation bar includes a how the website works, requirements, a community page, and an upload button. It will have high contrast between colors with a legible font for readability. The typography includes san serif fonts to give it a clean and modern look on the website.</p>
