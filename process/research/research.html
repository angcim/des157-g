    <h2>Final Project Research</h2>
  <p>
	The goal of my portfolio website is to improve and critique each other’s work to help better each other as designers. Well, the first question is, “what is a critique and how to critique someone?” As a designer, I receive great critiques and not so great ones. We need to learn what makes a critique “good” and what makes a critique “bad”. My first piece of research is on how to properly critique a writer. Even though this is for writing, I believe that this applies to critiquing designers as well. I researched how to properly critique a person’s work because I believe that critiquing is a skill that needs to be practice. A user can’t just say “oh that work is either good or bad” but needs to say why certain parts work and why some doesn’t. </p>

<p>In this article by Marion Dane Bauer, she explains what makes a good critique. The first thing she says is that “always begin your comments by naming something about the manuscript you like”. As a person who is critiquing, they need to make sure that they mention the designer’s strengths first, rather than starting out with their weaknesses. Writing down the designer’s strength shows the understanding of the work and can dive deeper into the details without hurting the designer’s self-esteem. The second tip of critiquing is to not try and fix whatever problems we see. It is not our job to tell the designer how to change their work, but we need to guide them to fix what is lacking. We need them to think of a way to help improve their weaknesses. For example, if their font size is too small, don’t say change the font size to this specific number, but say increase the size to make it more legible. Let them find their own solutions.

<p>The second piece of research I came across was “Social Media for Designers: The Best Channels to Share Your Work and Score New Clients” by Tessa Wegert. I thought that this article was useful because it shows a list of social medias that help benefit designers. The social media websites that are best for designers are Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and more. What do all these websites have in common? They are probably 90% photos, they can communicate with each other by comments and messages, and can have a following/friends base. These are necessary aspects for a designer’s website in order to make it successful. With this article, I want to take all the strengths and highlights of these website and combine it with a portfolio review website. I need these elements to help sell to my audience on why they should use it or why it is needed. </p>

<p>The third piece of research is about social media interactions and etiquette. Social media interactions are important in my website because this is going to be a community built on people around the world. There will be different types of people who learned different things and have different views and perspectives. Researching behaviors on social media helps create a better website because it will give me a better understanding on how to connect multiple designers with different personalities into one. People need to be able to respect each other’s views as they objectively critique each other’s work. This will help with the networking and building relationships aspect of the website. This research includes how people talk to each other online such as blogging and chatting. The main goal of this website is to improve each other without hurting each other. Online people are more critical and more opinionated as they can voice their thoughts anonymously. People are more likely to cyberbully and argue with each other over a computer screen, which is clearly not okay and will not be tolerated. With this issue, my website’s comments will most likely be moderated to see if the critiques are useful or not. </p>
