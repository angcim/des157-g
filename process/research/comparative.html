  <h3><a href="http://behance.net">Behance</a></h3>

    <h4>What is Behance.net?</h4>
  <p>Behance.net is a simple and easy to use portfolio website (owned by Adobe) that targets all kinds of designers. It is a great website to put designer’s work and projects. </p>

    <h4>Interface Design:</h4>
    <p>Behance has a clean, organized, and minimalistic layout, making the website professional. Another thing that adds to the clean look is the grid structure containing evenly spaced and shaped boxes. The clean layout is strongly effective for the website because it doesn’t hinder or get in the way of anyone’s work. The main focus is the designer’s work and not the website itself. The front page contains a featured posts page called “Best for Behance”. This creates a motivational and inspirational environment for all designers</p>

    <p>In terms of color and font choices, it uses legible text with high contrast between the background and the text. The white background is effective for the website because it brightens up everyone’s work and becomes the main focus. One issue with the typography is the small text sizes. As a person who has a huge screen, it is easy for me to read, but I can see that it will be a struggle for people who have smaller screens. Some examples of small text sizes are the navigation bar and the small descriptions in each preview of a post.</p>

    <h4>Interaction: </h4>
    <p>Behance is an extremely interactive website that gives users many tasks to do. Designers can solely just focus on inputting their work and setting up their portfolio page. These interactions include uploading images and typing descriptions and processes about their projects. Designers are also welcomed to browse through everyone’s work and comment/like on their pieces. This is a great way to receive feedback from the audience and get different perspective. </p>

    <h4>Overall Experience:</h4>
    <p>Behance is easy to use and easy to navigate. The content does not feel too overwhelming. Behance overall creates a welcoming and engaging space for designers who want to get out there. It’s a professional website and everyone treats everyone’s work with respect. Behance lets its audience know that this is a website for professional and amateur designers who want to get their work out there but don’t know where to start. It provides job listings and portfolio reviews (on given dates) as resources for people who want to gain more experience. </p>



    <h3><a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a></h3>
      <img src="../../images/dribbble.jpg" alt="dribbble" width="700" height="418" title="dribbble screen capture">
      <p class="source"><a href="https://dribbble.com/">(source: https://dribbble.com)</a></p>

      <h4>What is Dribbble.com?</h4>
    <p>Dribbble.com is another portfolio website that allows designers to showcase their work. The difference between Behance and Dribbble is in their users. Behance tends to have a more general design such as all kinds of graphic designs, photography, and architecture. Most of the users in Dribbble tend to focus on motion graphics, UI/UX, and web design.

      <h4>Interface Design:</h4>
      <p>Dribbble’s interface is similar, almost identical to Behance. It has that same clean, minimal and professional vibe. The homepage provides the same featured posts with a grid like structure. One of the key differences in Dribbble is that in the featured homepage it shows the name (or username) of the creator while Behance displays a description and title of the work. Both websites have the same layout and format but Dribbble gives a more playful environment based on its color choices. Their main header is bright yellow that stands out with a pink call of action. To make it extra friendly, there is an animation of a cute dog walking. The navigation is a dark gray and the text Is a lighter gray. Dribbble font contrast in its navigation is not legible. Not only are the font sizes small, but it does not have enough contrast. </p>

      <h4>Interaction: </h4>
      <p>Dribbble is an interactive portfolio website. Designers can put their work and set up their portfolio page. One interaction I found interesting is that in the portfolio pages, instead of a “message me” button it is a “hire me” button. I find this interaction effective because it indicates that this is a highly profession website for designers. It also indicates that this is where you can find designers if you need them for a job. Again, like Behance, it has similar symbols and icons for like buttons and viewers. In Behance, it has a tab for designers who are looking for job opportunities, but in Dribbble, it is the client who is looking for a designer. </p>

      <h4>Overall Experience:</h4>
      <p>Dribbble is easy to use and easy to navigate and straightforward. The website uses bright colors to make it a friendly environment but uses key words like “hire me” to indicate that it is still in a professional setting. Even though the website is inviting, I find it leaning more towards already experienced designers because of their word choices and they have actual design teams that work together in projects. Dribbble is definitely a designer to client setting rather than a designer to designer setting. </p>
